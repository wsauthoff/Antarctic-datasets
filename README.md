# Antarctic Datasets repo
This repo contains basic Python code recipes to open and explore frequently used Antarctic datasets. Code prioritizes direct access "streaming" cloud-hosted datasets when available. Code was written to run on [CryoCloud cloud-computing JupyterHub](https://cryointhecloud.com/).
